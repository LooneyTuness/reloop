# Product Views Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds real product view tracking to the application, replacing the previous simulated view counts with actual data from the database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- **Table**: `product_views` - Tracks individual product views
- **Functions**:
  - `get_product_view_count(product_uuid)` - Get view count for a specific product
  - `get_seller_view_stats(seller_uuid)` - Get aggregated view stats for a seller
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### 2. API Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/products/[id]/view` - Track a product view
- **GET** `/api/products/[id]/view` - Get view count for a product

### 3. Frontend Integration

- **Hook**: `useProductView` - Automatically tracks views when users visit product pages
- **Component**: Updated `ProductDetail` to use view tracking
- **Dashboard**: Real view counts displayed in analytics and product lifecycle

### 4. Data Service Updates

- `getProductViewCount()` - Fetch view count for a product
- `getSellerViewStats()` - Get seller's view statistics
- Updated `getSellerStats()` to include view data

## Database Migration

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- See product-views-migration.sql for the complete migration script
```

## How It Works

1. **View Tracking**: When a user visits a product detail page, the `useProductView` hook automatically tracks the view
2. **Data Storage**: View data is stored in the `product_views` table with metadata (IP, user agent, session, etc.)
3. **Analytics**: The dashboard displays real view counts and calculates accurate percentage changes
4. **Performance**: Views are tracked asynchronously to avoid impacting page load times

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **Real Data**: No more simulated view counts
- ✅ **Accurate Analytics**: Percentage changes based on actual data
- ✅ **Privacy Compliant**: Tracks views without storing personal data
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Non-blocking view tracking
- ✅ **Scalable**: Database functions handle large datasets efficiently

## Usage

The view tracking is automatic - no additional code needed in components. Simply use the `useProductView` hook:

```tsx
import { useProductView } from "../hooks/useProductView";

function ProductDetail() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);

  // Automatically tracks views when product is loaded
  useProductView({
    productId: id as string,
    enabled: !!id && !!product,
  });

  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Analytics Improvements

- **Real Percentages**: Dashboard now shows actual percentage changes instead of hardcoded values
- **View Statistics**: Total views, views in last 30 days, and per-product view counts
- **Trend Analysis**: Up/down trends based on real data comparison

## Security

- RLS policies ensure users can only see view data for their own products
- IP addresses are stored for analytics but not linked to user accounts
- Session tracking helps prevent duplicate view counting
